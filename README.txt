How to run Kath's Assignment 1:

1. Print out nest.jpg
2. load KBlairAssignment1 in Unity
3. Build and run (can use a laptop camera or build for Android; not testing with iOS)

The cardinal moves around its nest and sings when it gets to the last corner.  
I had wanted to do a couple of other things but I wasn't able to make the time work. They were:
- rotate the bird properly so it faces where it's going
-- make that rotation smooth and nice.
- There are a bunch of animations so have it fly or hop around its nest instead of ... sliding.

I know these things shouldn't be super difficult, but I was having a lot of trouble getting the bird to rotate at all, and I'm not sure why. The way I had rotated objects successfully in doing tutorials didn't work, and neither did a bunch of other things I tried. So since it wouldn't be facing the correct direction, it didn't make sense to me to try and get it to hop or fly while doing it.
