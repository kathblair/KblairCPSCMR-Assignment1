How to run Kath's Assignment 1:

1. Print out nest.jpg
2. load KBlairAssignment1 in Unity
3. Build and run (can use a laptop camera or build for Android; not testing with iOS)
4. Place the nest image in front of the camera, needs to be fairly visible (not at too steep of an angle).
The bird will keep moving through its steps if the app loses the tracker, but it only repeats once.

I used this pacakge of birds: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/living-birds-15649
And based this on the EasyAR MultiTracker Example we were working on in tutorial.

The cardinal moves around its nest and sings when it gets to the last corner.  
I had wanted to do a couple of other things but I wasn't able to make the time work. They were:
- rotate the bird properly so it faces where it's going
-- make that rotation smooth and nice.
- There are a bunch of animations so have it fly or hop around its nest instead of ... sliding.

I know these things shouldn't be super difficult, but I was having a lot of trouble getting the bird to rotate at all, and I'm not sure why. The way I had rotated objects successfully in doing tutorials didn't work, and neither did a bunch of other things I tried. So since it wouldn't be facing the correct direction, it didn't make sense to me to try and get it to hop or fly while doing it.
